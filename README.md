# GoofilyHacked
## Inspiration
Working with Python inspired me to explore all the domains python can conquer and hence I came up with Whatsapp Automation and Web Browser redirection using Python leading to GoofilyHacked. 
## What it does
* GoofilyHacked enables users to **spam their any WhatsApp Contact** with just a click! You can even customize the Spammed message and the number of spams.
* GoofilyHacked also enables **disabling your computer screen** by playing any youtube video on loop!
Highly Impractical right ?
## How I built it
It is built with Python and its framework- Flask

## Challenges I ran into
Integrating WhatsApp and Web browser services with python was a major challenge

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Everything! This project in itself is a major milestone as I was completely unaware of the libraries I've used within this.

## What I learned
I learned to integrate whatsapp and web browser services with python.

## What's next for GoofilyHacked
I aim to integrate sending Images on whatsapp through GoofilyHacked rather than just text
